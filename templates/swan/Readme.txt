-------------------------------------

*) Open a SWAN command prompt: go to Start, All Programs, Swan and click SWAN.
   (Alternatively, you may click the desktop SWAN icon or the SWAN quick launch icon.)

*) Change to the directory where your model input can be found using the CD command.

   where SWAN-inputfile is the name of your inputfile without extension.
   It is assumed that the extension is '.swn'.
